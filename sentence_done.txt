Motivation to work is part of the motivation to live.
Understanding the fruitfulness of work is one of the best pleasures.
The hardest job is the one we dare not start: it becomes a nightmare.
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
Work is not friendly, but it is an inevitable condition of a friendly life.
And after a bad harvest should be sown
Anyone who wants to eat a nut must break the shell
If there is no wind, take up the oars
Who wants to work - looking for means, who does not want - the reasons
To live means to work. Work is human life
The hardest part of the job is deciding to get started.
A human who works with his hands is a laborer; A human who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman: A human who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.
